# Ensemble Feature Importance Ranking (EFIR) Honors College Thesis

Data science is a rapidly growing industry permeating throughout every aspect of society.  Everything collects information these days, and this data can be used to find meaningful patterns leading to benefits ranging from more intuitive marketing to better cancer detection.  However, increased data collection leads to increased complexity, and data science works to manage this complexity through various techniques and machine learning/artificial intelligence models.  Two major problems faced by data scientists are too many features in a dataset and long model training times.  To help combat these issues, a tool called Ensemble Feature Importance Ranking (EFIR) was created.  This paper analyzes the accuracies and limitations of this innovative tool, overall proving that EFIR identifies the most impactful features in a dataset which leads to better data and faster model training times under various conditions.
